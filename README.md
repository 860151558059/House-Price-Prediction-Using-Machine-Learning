# House-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project predicts house prices based on various features such as number of rooms, area, location, etc. It is a beginner-friendly machine learning project using Python and scikit-learn.

 Objective

To develop a regression model that can predict the price of a house using features from a dataset.

 Technologies and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (EDA & visualization)
- Scikit-learn (modeling and evaluation)

 Project Workflow

1. Import & Load Data  
2. Data Cleaning  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   - Correlation heatmaps  
   - Scatter plots and distribution plots  
4. Feature Engineering
   - Selecting the most impactful features
5. Model Building
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor (or others)
6. Model Evaluation
   - Using MAE, MSE, RÂ² Score
 What I Learned

- Handling real-world data and preprocessing
- Encoding categorical and numerical features
- Visualizing data for pattern detection
- Building regression models
- Evaluating model accuracy
- Saving cleaned files and sharing a complete ML project on GitHub

Future Improvements

- Try more advanced models like Random Forest, XGBoost
- Add hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask
- Create a user interface for predictions
